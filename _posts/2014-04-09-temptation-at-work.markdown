Temptation keeps luring me back into this terrible habit.

Each week I have just 2 days of "have to do" work. And by that I mean the bits of work that I don't particularly enjoy, but which make me financially stable enough to support my lifestyle. The rest of my work time is spent on projects I'd continue to develop, even if no money were involved. Compared to many people around the world, this makes me incredibly lucky.

The work I do on those 2 days isn't even unpleasant, but I'd rather be exploring and testing one of the other exciting ideas running through my mind. So how do you balance that want and need? When you're in this interim where the projects you really love aren't yet able to give you the financial security that we all require in real life, how do you stay focused?

Right now, I do it badly.

One day last week I worked myself into mild anxiety thinking that I couldn't possibly fit all of the things I needed to do into 7 days. I don't know what bizarre calculations I was working with, but that is clearly just wrong.

Purely subjectively, I do have quite a lot going on. I'm involved with a far wider selection of projects than I ever have been before. For my passion projects (my coups de coeur, as I now like to call them because being surrounded by the French brings out my more pretentious traits) there's always something I want to be doing, it's just a matter of prioritising which bits I can - and need to - do right now, and which will need to wait. And for my core clients, I can easily find useful, and even reasonably interesting, things to do for those 2 days a week, with enough longer term goals to work towards for the next few months. 

In reality, most of the things I'm worrying about don't even have deadlines. Very few of them NEED to be done in any given week. I have complete freedom to decide which bits to work on and complete control over my prioritisation. Why does that make things so difficult?!

A few weeks ago I gave a presentation at Freelance Day in Turin; my key point was that as a freelancer you have both freedom and control. You set your own boundaries, goals and deadlines. This is definitely one of the best things about working this way but it's also, for me, the biggest challenge! Every time I start doing a piece of work, I'm opting in to doing it. There's no one standing over my shoulder, or shouting down the phoneline. I'm doing the work because I choose to be doing the work.

So I started to think about why, when I have the freedom to plan my own days, I was feeling so crushed by my workload. 

A very French ex-boyfriend once told me to always do what I want to do, not what I feel I must do. Admittedly he was trying to seduce me at the time so perhaps it's not the most reliable advice for life, but the ideology has been re-enforced in far more sensible contexts since then. Several strangers and friends, for whom I have an incredible amount of respect, have offered me a more practical grasp on this concept and how it fits into my life. 

While I wholeheartedly believe that people should strive to do what they love, it's entirely unrealistic, and indeed counter-productive, to seek a life in which instant gratification is the sole objective. Naturally there will be some things we don't enjoy doing as much as others and that's not a problem, as long as we work out how these pieces help us work towards our goals. A plan within a plan within a plan, as Ben would say.

But as much as I understand this idea conceptually, I struggle to implement it in real life. 

When I'm planning my day, I seek out the shiny things like a magpie. With ten options in mind, it's so hard to choose to do the one which is least exciting, but most necessary. Even once I've made that choice, it's a constant, often fruitless, mission to keep my attention from succumbing to intrigue and wandering the depths of my imagination to explore the more engaging ideas.

In an average week, conscious of the fact that I've spent three quarters of Monday distracted by my other projects, a day of client work is passed on to Tuesday, then a little bit trickles over to Wednesday. By the time I reach my second scheduled day on Thursday, I'm not only feeling guilty but am also resenting the work for pulling my focus away from my other ventures. So I rebel against it and spend a little bit of Thursday working on more exciting things. Of course, come Friday I'm once again feeling both guilty and behind on my work so I put in another half day to make sure I've caught up for the week.

Those 2 days of work are being dragged out across an entire week. I spend at least five days oscilating between the projects I love and those I feel guilty for neglecting. In consequence, I struggle to give either category my undivided attention and I feel like I'm spending every day working on something I don't enjoy as much as I'd like to. And this is why, despite only having 2 days of "have to do" stuff in a week, I've been feeling overwhelmed.

Before opening my laptop the morning after my little anxiety attack, I made myself a list. A real one, on paper. I wrote down every single task, thought and idea that was floating around - or weighing on - my mind for each of my clients, and my personal business development. I'm sure you'll be shocked to hear that this did make me feel better, it got rid of that unhelpful feeling of urgency. And I've been able to make this week a lot more structured and productive. 

I hadn't ever imagined that the primary temptation luring me from my work would be something as wholesome as more exciting work. But really it's just as detrimental as any other bad habit, so who has tips on how to stay focused on the things you need to do when you're longing to work on your coup de coeur instead?
